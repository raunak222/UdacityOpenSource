## 1 Federated Learning on VMMR Cars Dataset

### - Motivation/Purpose: 
- Main Purpose of this project is rather than using normal training, we use federated learning in order to train our model. we build our own custom federated data loader. Before training we visualized our datasets and make it feasible for training.
Benefits of doing this is to build the model on the device so that data does not have to be moved to a centralized server. In order to provide more security.
